## Hi there 👋

### Introduction
The Realization of RObotic Systems (RROS) laboratory at USC is a facility for graduate and undergraduate robotics research and education with an emphasis on studying the motion of robotic systems for a variety of practical applications. 

Our research interests are in the area of planning for high degrees of freedom robotic systems, motion planning of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), physics aware decision making for multi-robot systems, and self-directed learning.

We are a member of Center for Advanced Manufacturing ([CAM](https://cam.usc.edu/))
