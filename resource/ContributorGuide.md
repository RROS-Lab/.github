### Create a Repository on GitHub
1. It is highly recommended to use the template repository [rros-template-repo](https://github.com/RROS-Lab/rros-template-repo) when you create a new repository.

1. If the new repository is public, please contact any member in the admin team so we can update the repository list.


### Bind Local Repository with Remote Repository
Now you have already create a remote repository on the GitHub, the next step is to bind it with your local repository. There are three kinds of situation.

1. You do not have a local repository  
    This means you have not run `git init` in your target directory / folder.

    Now all you need to do is run
    
    `git clone [your remote repository link]` 

    Then you can start coding in your local repository.

1. You have init a local repository without any remote repository bound with it  
    Run:  
    `git remote add origin [your remote repository link]` 

1. You have init a local repositoryï¼Œbut there is already a remote repository bound with it  
    Save your work first  
    Then run:  
    `git remote set-url origin [your NEW remote repository link]`
