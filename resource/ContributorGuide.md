### Create a Repository on GitHub
1. It is highly recommended to use the template repository [rros_template_repo](https://github.com/RROS-Lab/rros_template_repo) when you create a new repository.

2. Add the "admin" team to your new repository.

### Bind Local Repository with Remote Repository
Now you have already create a remote repository on the GitHub, the next step is to bind it with your local repository. There are three kinds of situation.

1. You do not have a local repository  
    This means you have not run `git init` in your target directory / folder.

    Now all you need to do is run
    
    `git clone [your remote repository link]` 

    Then you can start coding in your local repository.

1. You have init a local repository without any remote repository bound with it  
    Run:  
    `git remote add origin [your remote repository link]` 

1. You have init a local repositoryï¼Œbut there is already a remote repository bound with it  
    Save your work first  
    Then run:  
    `git remote set-url origin [your NEW remote repository link]`



### Make a Repository Public

1. Please contact any member in the [admin team](https://github.com/orgs/RROS-Lab/teams/admin) so we can update the repository list.

1. Delete ".gitignore" file

1. Write a README


### Manage Branches

1. For any new feature, we highly recommended you start a new brach and work on it (to make the main branch clean).   

    For example, if you want to develop a feature "dance" on a robot. After talking with the project manager, you can add a new branch in the local repo, e.g.,"feature/dance" by using  
    `git checkout -b feature/dance`  
    Then you can work on it (`git add` / `git commit`)

1. If you finished your work and the code has passed all the tests, inform the project manager, and push your branch to GitHub. Then you can merge your branch to the main branch.  
    
    - switch to the main brach using  
        `git checkout main`  
    - merge branch using  
      `git merge --squash feature/dance`  
      `git commit -m "merge branch feature/dance to main"`  
      `git push`
